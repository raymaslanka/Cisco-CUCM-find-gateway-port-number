Cisco Analog Gateway Port Number Finder

This is a small sample of how to retrieve a CUCM analog gateway description and voice-port number given the MAC address of the analog phone.

This eliminates the need to manually find the gateway after modifying the MAC address and then convert the MAC to a physical port. 

There is little error handling and no input verification here. This is just a sample of the associated AXL API usage.
